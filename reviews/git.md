# Git Intro

Git is **Distributed Version Control System**

Git is not GitHub

## Git Staging Area

Add files with changes to the staging area to be included in a commit.

`git add .` - adds all files with changes to the staging area
`git add <FILENAME>` - adds a file to the staging area

## Git Commits

Creates a _snapshot_ of the changes that have been added to the staging area

"Commit early and often"

`git commit -m "message"` - description should be brief and concise; sums up what changes you made

## Working with Remote Repositories

`git clone` - copies a git repository

`git push` - pushes commits to remote repo

`git pull` - pulls commits from a remote repo

## Command Line

The Command Line interface is a non-visual interface for performing operations on your computer.

`ls` or `dir` - lists contents of a directory
`cd <PATH>` or `dir <PATH>` - navigates the filesystem (moves you to a new directory)
`mkdir <NAME>` - create a new folder
`rm -rf <NAME>` or `rmdir /s <NAME>` - delete a folder
`rm <NAME>` - deletes a file

`..` - shorthand for parent directory
`.` - shorthand for current directory
